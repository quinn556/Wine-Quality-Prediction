# Wine-Quality-Prediction
Here I perform EDA, data visualization, and fit machine learning classification models on a data set that contains information on wine characteristics.

I'll use Tidymodels to fit random forest, xgboost, and knn classification models to predict the wine quality, which I group into "Low", "Medium", and "High". 

This aims to show my skills in R, statistics, machine learning, EDA, and presentation.
