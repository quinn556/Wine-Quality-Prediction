# Wine-Quality-Prediction
Here I perform EDA, data visualization, and fit machine learning classification models on a data set that contains information on wine characteristics.

I'll use Tidymodels to fit random forest and xgboost classification models to predict the wine quality, which I group into "Low", "Medium", and "High". These are great classifiers for outcome variables with multiple units. I also want to focus on gradient boosting because it works well with imbalanced outcome variables, like the one we have here.

This aims to show my skills in R, statistics, machine learning, EDA, and presentation.
